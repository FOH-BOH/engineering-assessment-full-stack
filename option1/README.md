# Option 1: Match Candidates with Positions

Show employers the candidates that are the "best match" for a position.

## User Story
As a hiring manager, I want to see candidates that are most likely to be a potentially “good” candidate, so that I can optimize my time reviewing candidates that best fit my open role.

## Directions
Beginning with the Django project in this directory and the associated fixtures, build an application that sorts Candidates by the "best match" for a given Position. Match criteria should include geography and positions sought/offered.

### Front End
 * Build components to display candidates in a list format

### Back End
 * Install Django, set up project, and install fixtures
 * Build a GraphQL query to display the most relevant candidates
