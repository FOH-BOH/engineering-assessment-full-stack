# foh&boh Engineering Assessment

Thanks for your interest in engineering at foh&boh! You're probably here as a next step
in the application process for an open position with us. 

## Assessment Details
Pick from one of the following take-home assessments. During the assessment code review, we’ll talk about why you chose that particular project and go through your work and approach. 

 * [Option 1: Match Candidates with Positions](option1/README.md)
 * [Option 2: Build an Interview Schedule](option2/README.md)

We’ll also ask you about how you might have approached the other project option during the interview process, but you are not required to actually complete the work. We’re looking for a frame of reference on how you might start the thought process on a project, as it’s also something you’ll come up against during your day-to-day in our stack.

Please do not spend more than 2-4 hours on this work, and make sure to record how much time you spent in total for frame of reference. Also, please document how to run your application via a README.md.

### What we'll be looking for:
 * End-to-end functionality
 * Code style & readability
 * Some level of test coverage

### Tools you should use:
 * React
 * Django
 * GraphQL
   * Graphene is our go-to but you can choose another framework (and teach us a bit about why)
   * Apollo


### What we'll be asking about:
 * Your general approach to the problem
 * What challenges you encountered, and if/how you overcame them
 * What you enjoyed (and what you didn't like) about the work
 * What we could improve about this process :)
